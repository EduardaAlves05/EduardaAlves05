## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
Hello, my name is Eduarda Alves.

I am currently studying Systems Analysis and Development at Cruzeiro do Sul University, with a focus on Cybersecurity.

As part of my studies, I developed a calculator project using Visualg. The project performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, helping reinforce logic and programming fundamentals.
